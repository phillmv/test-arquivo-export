body: "#gitsync \r\n\r\nended up doing a lot of refactoring to the Importer, Exporter
  and LocalSyncer.\r\n\r\nAn intuition I had: that maybe these classes should be renamed.\r\n\r\nThe
  Exporter really is…………… `SyncDatabaseToDisk` or `SyncWithDisk` and the Importer
  really is `SyncDiskToDatabase` or `SyncWithDatabase`. The LocalSyncer is a `SyncWithGit`
  which in turn uses a `GitAdapter`.\r\n\r\nMaybe! Something like that. But then it
  becomes clear that the SyncWithGit has to call SyncWithDisk and then the GitAdapter
  etc."
