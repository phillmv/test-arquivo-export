body: "been working on a middleman compilation github action to automatically convert
  arquivo entries into static webpages so i can share my notes with colleagues.\r\n\r\nlet's
  call this…… #webexport\r\n\r\nthe idea is that it would also make it super easy
  to create a tumblelog / mood board directly from arquivo.\r\n\r\ni've gotten quite
  far; i've exported the stylesheet, the layout, the precise markdown settings i use
  here. remaining step i think is converting directly from arquivo entry yaml to middleman
  blog post entries.\r\n\r\none way to achieve this would be a simple converter -
  dir[*] across the yaml files and output new entries - but why do that when i could
  just have it read the files directly?\r\n\r\n/me goes looking inside the guts of
  middleman"
