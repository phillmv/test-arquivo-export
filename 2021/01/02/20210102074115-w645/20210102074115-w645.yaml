body: "#gitsync \r\n\r\nsuccessfully split classes out as named above.\r\n\r\nwhile
  writing it out, realized that the SyncWithGit class was being called from SyncFromDisk.
  This makes sense in a dropbox import method, but broke a test because some yaml
  was re-serialized slightly differently and broke a test.\r\n\r\n(note to self:\r\n-
  [x] test entry.to_yaml -> disk -> from yaml -> to disk interaction, assert no changes
  if possible\r\n\r\n)\r\n\r\ni think i now can finally work on the git interaction,
  separately from committing an individual entry. git pull - but there's a conflict.
  git push, but there's a conflict."
